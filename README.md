Berenice's Notebook

Dear sir, madam, or otherwise:

I'm Berenice, a young human female living within the Milky Way Galaxy on a planet known to us as Earth. I enjoy reading a lot of books. My particular favorites include Poor Charlie's Almanac, A Little Princess, The Obstacle is the Way, and Rich Dad, Poor Dad. I also enjoy using the internet(particularly Youtube) to study new skills and concepts like foreign languages, how to get into optimal physique, and ecommerce.
